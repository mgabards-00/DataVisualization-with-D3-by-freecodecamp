# Data-Visualization-with-D3-freecodecamp-
D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.


This contains the step by step task or process when I'm did the freecodecamp course for Data Visualization.

I included the lessons followed by the task and my solution at the end.

For visuals, I'll make an update asap.
